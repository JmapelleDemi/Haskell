Intermission: Short Exercise

  In the Chapter Exercises at the end of Recursion, you were given this
exercise:
  Write a function that multiplies two numbers using recursive sum-
mation. The type should be (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a -> a although,
depending on how you do it, you might also consider adding an Ord
constraint.
  If you still have your answer, great! If not, rewrite it and then
write Hspec tests for it.
